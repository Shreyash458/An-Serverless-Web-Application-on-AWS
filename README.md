# An-Serverless-Web-Application-on-AWS
I have build a Serverless web application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3. The application will allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) items from a DynamoDB table.

Project Architecture: ![Serverless Web Application Architecture](https://github.com/Shreyash458/An-Serverless-Web-Application-on-AWS/assets/163305446/343f9347-deaa-4e5b-8ad1-614a7c953c51)

### Followed Steps:

* Created a DynamoDB table to store the items. \
* Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table. \
* Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). \
* Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency. \

### Expected Outcome:

Successfully deployed a fully functional serverless web application, providing users with a seamless experience for 
managing data. 
Achieved scalability and cost savings by leveraging serverless architecture and managed AWS services.
